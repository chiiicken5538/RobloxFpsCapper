# RobloxFpsCapper
This script is an interactive tool to modify the Frames Per Second cap in the Roblox client settings. Users run this script to change the FPS cap to a desired value. The script manually overrides specific parameters in the Roblox Client Settings. It's emphasized that using this script won't result in bans as it doesn't alter the Roblox client directly; it merely modifies a settings file within the Roblox directory. If the Roblox client updates, users might need to run the script again to reapply their desired FPS cap.

I might update the script at some point, but that will probably not affect your current version, so there is no need to re-download the file when there is an update. 
The script will also not force you to download a new version. It won't even let you know. 

## How does this work? 
This works by simply just overriding the Roblox Client's Settings manually. There are a lot of modifications that you can change by changing them manually inside a ClientAppSettings File.

### To get more in the detail
This script is changing the `DFIntTaskSchedulerTargetFps` value to the amount of FPS that you want. 

## Can I get banned for this? 
No, you can not. This script is not doing anything to your Roblox Client. It just changes a settings file inside your Roblox directory. 

## My FPS are capped again at 60 FPS after a few days. Why? 
Well, when Roblox updates, then your internal Roblox Client files are moving to a different directory where Roblox is using the default Client Settings. 
You just need to run this script again once so this script can override your default Roblox Client settings again. 

## How can you trust this? 
You can trust this file because it is an open source Microsoft Batch file. If you want, you can right-click the file and press on 'Edit' so you can see the source code. (or you can just view the source on this GitHub Repository)
I am aware that Virus Total does not detect loggers and stuff, but some people feel safer when they see a Virus Total result so  [here is a VirusTotal result from this script.](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a782e4ef65a1f2f3e3d80e97100d3a7bc35d5269ee677ead07a080621d37765b?nocache=1)
